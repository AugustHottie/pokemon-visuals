# Pokémon Data Visualization & Data Story Project
### Come Visualize the world of Pokemon!

## Introduction
Welcome to the Pokémon Data Visualization and Data Story Project! In this project, we explore and visualize data from the Pokémon dataset to gain insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and overall performance of different Pokémon, and then tell a story based on our insights.

## Dataset
